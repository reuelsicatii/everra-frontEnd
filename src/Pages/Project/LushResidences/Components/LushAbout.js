                                    1. Location. Location. Location. The 3 most important consideration when buying property.
                                    LUSH Residences is in a very prime location accessible to major commercial and business
                                    centers thru a covered walkway so itâ€™s convenient to walk rain or shine. No need to take transportation
                                    as everywhere in Makati CBD is within walking distance as this is just very near Ayala Avenue.
                                    Walking is good for the health, too, so buying into this property will be a very good decision.

                                    2. Low density building. This is a one (1)- building development with only several residential floors that start on the 7th floor. Only 19 floors of residential units. Parking is on the 2nd floor up to the 6th floor.

                                    3. Unique design. This unique design allows to have more prime units with panoramic views.

                                    4. Green wall feature. LUSH Residences is envisioned and planned to be surrounded by greenery that is truly living up to its name. With this lush vegetation around the building, its amenity level will have better air flow what with the fresh oxygen coming out from the plants while toxic fumes are filtered by such plants. Now that is healthier.

                                    5. Public art facility. This will be open to the public for art enthusiasts which is good for the soul and spirit.
